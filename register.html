        Complaints and Disputes Resolution
        THE ORGANISATION’s aim is to ensure that all customers always have a great experience when using THE PORTAL. However, THE ORGANISATION recognizes there are occasions where THE PORTAL may not have been able to meet a User’s expectations, and in doing so, THE ORGANISATION would want to hear from them as soon as possible so that THE ORGANISATION may resolve their concern quickly and fairly.
        
        THE ORGANISATION’s Customer Service team (Contact US) is highly trained to resolve any queries in order to provide a satisfactory outcome. On the rare occasions where this is not possible, a User can request for their complaint to be escalated to a senior team member, who will independently review and seek resolution to their complaint.
        
        Making a Complaint
        Should a User wish to raise a complaint, they can Contact Us.
        
        What to Provide

        Name
        Email
        Game ID

        If a User is not satisfied with THE ORGANISATION’s response, they can request an escalation, which will be overseen by a member of THE ORGANISATION’s Customer Service Management team. This should be viewed as THE ORGANISATION’s final response.
