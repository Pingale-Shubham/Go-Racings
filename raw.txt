          Complaints Procedure
          Complaint Registration
          THE ORGANISATION treats all complaints and disputes seriously and is fully committed to ensuring that any
          received are dealt with in a fair, open and timely manner.

          Complaints and Disputes Resolution
          THE ORGANISATIONâs aim is to ensure that all customers always have a great experience when using THE PORTAL.
          However, THE ORGANISATION recognizes there are occasions where THE PORTAL may not have been able to meet a
          Userâs expectations, and in doing so, THE ORGANISATION would want to hear from them as soon as possible so
          that THE ORGANISATION may resolve their concern quickly and fairly.

          THE ORGANISATIONâs Customer Service team (Contact US) is highly trained to resolve any queries in order to
          provide a satisfactory outcome. On the rare occasions where this is not possible, a User can request for their
          complaint to be escalated to a senior team member, who will independently review and seek resolution to their
          complaint.

          Making a Complaint
          Should a User wish to raise a complaint, they can Contact Us.

          What to Provide
          In order to resolve a Userâs complaint as quickly as possible it is important that they provide THE
          ORGANISATION with as much information as they can, including:

          Name
          Email
          Game ID
          Unique Identification Number

          ORGANISATIONâs Customer Service team to assess and resolve. THE ORGANISATION will respond within 48 hours.

          If a User is not satisfied with THE ORGANISATIONâs response, they can request an escalation, which will be
          overseen by a member of THE ORGANISATIONâs Customer Service Management team. This should be viewed as THE
          ORGANISATIONâs final response.

          of any issue what-so-ever, Stewards of THE ORGANISATION can and will take an appropriate decision and such
          decision would be binding on all Patrons who have participated and that such Patrons on logging into THE
          PORTAL, agree to waive their rights to contest such decisions.
          The Judges Placing/Final Results of each race as declared by the Event Organizers will be used to declare the

          on THE PORTAL

          as-Is basis and may not be guaranteed.
          Live Race streaming may be limited to Patrons and the criteria of who would be entitled to view Live Races
          will be decided by THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL and would be binding on the Patrons. Live Race streaming of an

          THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL reserves the right to Cancel/Declare Void an Event/Race at any time and with assigning
          any reason what-so-ever. Any investments done for such an Event/Race would be refunded as per the Rules of

          contest any decisions of THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL.
          Patrons may note that THE PORTAL, may where feasible, offer to present the Probable Dividends and/or ODDs
          being declared by the Event Organizers. It may be noted that such Probable Dividends/ODDs being presented are
          ONLY for their information and would be in the local currency of the Event/Race and such Dividends would NOT
          be the Dividends applicable to Winning Tickets on this PORTAL. In addition to such information, THE PORTAL
          would as usual present Patrons with the Probable Dividends being offered by THE PORTAL which would be based on
          the Betting Patterns of the local participating Patrons.
          If the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void.
          If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, The Organisation will use its reasonable endeavours to
          ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all race and bets after the time of the 'off' determined by The
          Organisation will be void.
          The Organisation aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend the acceptance of bets at the start of the
          event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, The Organisation does not guarantee that
          such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
          All the bets placed after the scheduled off time of the race will be void.
          Customers are responsible for managing their timing of race and bets all the time.
          Any miss bets due to any technical problems will not be organisationâs responsibility and player has to bear
          any such losses incurred during the downtime.
          We strictly follow international racing rules followed by Swyom, Swyomsoft and Swyom Enterprises.

          provide a satisfactory outcome. On the rare occasions where this is not possible, a User can request for their

          complaint.

          overseen by a member of THE ORGANISATIONâs Customer Service Management team. This should be viewed as THE
          ORGANISATIONâs final response.

          Race. If it is based on the minimum investment amount then the same will be decided by THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL
          and can change without any notice. The criteria can be changed at any time by THE ORGANISATION and without
          giving any reason and notice
          The Race Card for the Events would be as that declared by the Event Organizers
          The Withdraw of Racing Elements, change of Racing Elements, etc. would be as declared by the Event Organizers
          The Race Timings, Start of the Race, Cancellation of an Event/Race, etc. would be as declared by the Event
          Organizers
          The Judges Placing/Final Results would be as declared by the Event Organizers
          The Single Leg Pools for each Event would be as declared by the Stewards of THE ORGANISATION
          By logging into THE PORTAL the Patron agrees to abide by all the Terms & Conditions of THE PORTAL including
          the additional Terms & Conditions under Rules and Conditions for International Racing.
          THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL reserves the right to Cancel/Declare Void an Event/Race at any time and with assigning
          any reason what-so-ever. Any investments done for such an Event/Race would be refunded as per the Rules of
          Racing of THE PORTAL. On logging-in into THE PORTAL, Patrons agree that they are not permitted to and will not
          contest any decisions of THE ORGANISATION/PORTAL.
          Patrons may note that THE PORTAL, may where feasible, offer to present the Probable Dividends and/or ODDs
          being declared by the Event Organizers. It may be noted that such Probable Dividends/ODDs being presented are
          ONLY for their information and would be in the local currency of the Event/Race and such Dividends would NOT
          be the Dividends applicable to Winning Tickets on this PORTAL. In addition to such information, THE PORTAL
          would as usual present Patrons with the Probable Dividends being offered by THE PORTAL which would be based on
          the Betting Patterns of the local participating Patrons.
          If the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time will be void.
          If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, The Organisation will use its reasonable endeavours to
          ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all race and bets after the time of the 'off' determined by The
          Organisation will be void.
          The Organisation aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend the acceptance of bets at the start of the
          event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, The Organisation does not guarantee that
          such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.
          All the bets placed after the scheduled off time of the race will be void.
          Customers are responsible for managing their timing of race and bets all the time.
          Any miss bets due to any technical problems will not be organisationâs responsibility and player has to bear
          any such losses incurred during the downtime.
          We strictly follow international racing rules followed by Swyom, Swyomsoft and Swyom Enterprises.
